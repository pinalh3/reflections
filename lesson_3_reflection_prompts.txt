When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

I would use a remote repository when i want to share it with other people or to be accesible from other places
or even if i want other people to colaborate with me

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Because there is a chance i want to access the remote repo only when i need it to be accesible
